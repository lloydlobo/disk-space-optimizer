    # - Checkout: Checkout the repository's code to the runner's file system.
    # - Build cargo docs in docs/rustdoc: Build the cargo documentation and store it in the "./docs/rustdoc" folder.
    # - Create index.html in docs/rustdoc/doc: Create an "index.html" file in the "./docs/rustdoc/doc" folder which redirects to the "mausam" page.
    # - Commit and push changes: Uses the actions/github-script@v6 action to run a script that stages all changes, sets the user email and name, creates a commit with the message "docs: add index.html and build cargo docs", and pushes the changes to the master branch on the remote repository.
    # - Setup Pages: Configure the GitHub Pages for the repository.
    # - Upload artifact: Upload the artifact "./docs/doc".
    # - Deploy to GitHub Pages: Deploy the documentation to the GitHub Pages.
